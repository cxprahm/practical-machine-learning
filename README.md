This analysis corresponds to the prediction assignment for Practical Machine
Learning course offered by John Hopkin's University through Coursera. The 
dataset for the assignment is obtained from http://groupware.le. Based on
the website, the data is gathered using different sensors while 6
participants exercised in different fashions. The way they exercised are
categorized into A, B, C, D, and E; A being the correct way of doing the
exercise and B-E including some level of mistakes.The goal of the assignment
is to build an algorithm that takes different fields in the dataset and
predicts the associated exercise category correctly.
